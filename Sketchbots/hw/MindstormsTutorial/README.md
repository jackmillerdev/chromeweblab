## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn to use the Chrome Web Lab's Sketchbot open source Sketchbot library in order to build your very own web-controlled drawing machine!

Since building robots can be an expensive endeavor, we will try to minimize cost (and complexity) by making a drawing robot using [Lego Mindstorms NXT](http://mindstorms.lego.com/).

Like its bigger brother, the Mindstorms Sketchbot will use a 3-axis arm to manipulate a physical 'stylus' in order to tranposes a vector-based image onto a two-dimensional surface like paper.

After assembling Lego Mindstorms NXT drawing robot, getting the dependencies installed on your machine and running the Sketchbot code, the library will handle everything from the image capture, to the conversion to vector-based machine code (i.e. [gcode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code)) that the drawing robot can understand.

For a full description of the history and concept of the project see [this page](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ChromeWebLab/tree/master/Sketchbot).

Here's an example video of what you can expect after getting everything setup!

*NOTES:*

*The Lego Mindstorms NXT sketchbot is NOT a high-precision drawing robot by any means. This is primarily due to its physical motor limitations and loose tolerances. However, it does demonstrate how a complete drawing system works, by going from web interface to physical sketch and providing a great jumping off point for anyone interested in building more advanced drawing machines using the Chrome Web Lab's Sketchbot library.*


*Also note that this tutorial assumes some basic knowledge about programming in JavaScript, using the terminal and assembling mechanical (albeit simplified lego-based) parts.*
