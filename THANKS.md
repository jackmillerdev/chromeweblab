Thanks
======

This project is not a one man project, it involved lots of developers and teams contributing to make this.

In no particular order.

Thanks to:

*  [Brian Hinch](http://github.com/brianhinch), Tell Art and responsible for a lot of the magic
*  
*  People at B-Reel for porting the production interface
*  [Paul Kinlan](http://github.com/paulkinlan)
*  Jayme Goldstein for getting all the internal Google bods lined up.

If you would like to be in this list, we would love for you to help us grow this project.  If you want to help
code we have an [Issue list](http://github.com/GoogleChrome/ChromeWebLab/issues) that has a lot of tasks that 
we need to still get completed.

If you have any interesting projects built with Chrome Web Lab, add them to our [projects page](http://github.com/GoogleChrome/ChromeWebLab/blob/master/PROJECTS.md)
and let us know so we can get it promoted.
