# Web Lab

[Web Lab](http://www.chromeweblab.com) is made of up 5 Chrome Experiment installations that bring the extraordinary workings of the internet to life and aims to inspire the world about the possibilities of the web. 

The installations have been up a year-long public exhibition at the Science Museum, London and can be interacted with by anyone, anywhere at chromeweblab.com.

Worldwide visitors both on and offline will be able to make music with people across the world; launch information into cyberspace and see where images on the web live; watch their portrait being processed, translated, and then drawn in sand by a robot; and travel instantly to far away places all over the world.

This Open Source project makes two of the experiments - [Orchestra](Orchestra) and
[Sketchbots](Sketchbots) - available for you to build and host yourself.
