# The Dremelphone 2013

## Introduction
This hardware demo is here to give an example of a 'musical' instrument that can be developed using the Universal Orchestra code from the Chrome Web Labs. For a full rundown on the History and Concept of the project you can go [here](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ChromeWebLab/tree/master/Orchestra). 

But we're here to make an instrument. Specifically, this one:

![Dremelphone](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ChromeWebLab/blob/hardware-tutorials-dev/Orchestra/hw/tutorial/images/intro1.jpg)

The Dremelphone. A Dremel powered, servo percussive tonal experience unlike any other.

## What We'll Be Using

Electronics:
Arduino
4 RS120 Servos
MIDI Connector
Optoisolator
Resistors: 220, 270, 100 (2), 1000
Diode
Voltage?
12 volt power supply

Base:
4 Glasses
Dremel with flex shaft
10" diameter wooden clock base, 3/4" thick
3/4" thick solid wood (we used a spare stair tread we had laying around, plywood would also work)
  enough for 4 3" squares, and 4 3/4" x 3/4" x 1" blocks
3/16" ply for cams (1/8" would work), a 3" x 10" piece is plenty
Thumb Tacks
Masking Tape
Small wooden bead (1)
Cotton twine
4 3" narrow hinges with screws

## Electronics

Follow the images and wiring diagram.

## Building the Base

1. Layout on Clock Face
We're going to lay out all the cutlines on the clock face first. First, draw two perpendicular diameters. Make a mark at 2" and 2 1/4" in from the circle's edge along each line. The 2" mark is where we're going to drill. 

2. Drill and Cut Slots

3. Cut Cam and other Parts

4. Predrill for Screws

5. Attach cams to servos

6. Align servos in slots and mark

7. Attach Hinges and Servos

8. Attach Base Legs

9. Connect wiring

10. Glue Glasses

11. Make Threaded Bead

12. Tune Glasses with water

13. Fire it up!
