# The Dremelphone 2013

## Introduction
This hardware demo is here to give an example of a 'musical' instrument that can be developed using the Universal Orchestra code from the Chrome Web Labs. For a full rundown on the History and Concept of the project you can go [here](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ChromeWebLab/tree/master/Orchestra). 

But we're here to make an instrument. Specifically, this one:

The Dremelphone. A Dremel powered, servo percussive tonal experience unlike any other.

## Materials

The first step is to acquire all of the parts we will need to build this project. 

Electronics:

| Quantity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 1        | Arduino &mdash; nearly any will do, such as the [Leonardo](http://store.arduino.cc/ww/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=11_12&products_id=226) |
| 4        | [RS120 Servos](#LINK) |
| 1        | [DIN 5/180 MIDI Connector](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9536) |
| 1        | [XXXXX Optoisolator](#LINK) |
| 1        | 220ohm resistor |
| 1        | 270ohm resistor |
| 2        | 100ohm resistors |
| 1        | 1kOhm resistor |
| 1        | [XXXXXX diode](#LINK) |
| 1        | 12 volt DC power supply &mdash; such as [this one](#LINK) |
| spool    | Red hookup wire |
| spool    | Black hookup wire |
| 1        | [breadboard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9567) |

Other materials:

| Quantity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 4        | drinking glasses &mdash; any kind will do, really |
| 1        | [Dremel hobby tool with flex shaft, or similar motorized rotary tool](https://www.google.com/search?q=dremel+tool+with+flex+shaft) |
| 1        | [10" diameter wooden clock base, 3/4" thick](#LINK) |
| quarter-sheet | quarter sheet of 3/4" plywood &mdash; we used scrap wood we had laying around, enough for 4 3" squares, and 4 3/4" x 3/4" x 1" blocks |
| quarter-sheet | 3/16" plywood for cams (1/8" would work), a 3" x 10" piece is plenty |
| 1 box    | [Thumb Tacks](http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/323873/OIC-Thumb-Tacks-No-2-38/) |
| | Masking Tape |
| 1        | Small wooden bead |
| a few inches | Cotton twine |
| 4        | 3" narrow hinges with screws &mdash; [like these](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-3-in-Zinc-Plated-Non-Removable-Pin-Narrow-Utility-Hinges-2-Pack-15168/202033931#.UgQn92Tm3kg) |

Tools:

* Band saw or handheld jigsaw
* Scissors
* Hot glue gun and a little bit of hot glue
* Wire cutter/stripper

## Electronics

1. Follow the images and wiring diagram.

## Building the Base

1. Layout on Clock Face
We're going to lay out all the cutlines on the clock face first. First, draw two perpendicular diameters. Make a mark at 2" and 2 1/4" in from the circle's edge along each line. The 2" mark is where we're going to drill. 

2. Drill and Cut Slots

3. Cut Cam and other Parts

4. Predrill for Screws

5. Attach cams to servos

6. Align servos in slots and mark

7. Attach Hinges and Servos

8. Attach Base Legs

9. Connect wiring

10. Glue Glasses

11. Make Threaded Bead

12. Tune Glasses with water

13. Fire it up!
