# The Dremelphone 2013

## Introduction
This hardware demo is here to give an example of a 'musical' instrument that can be developed using the Universal Orchestra code from the Chrome Web Labs. For a full rundown on the History and Concept of the project you can go [here](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ChromeWebLab/tree/master/Orchestra). 

But we're here to make an instrument. Specifically, this one:

![Dremelphone](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ChromeWebLab/blob/hardware-tutorials-dev/Orchestra/hw/tutorial/images/intro1.jpg)

The Dremelphone. A Dremel powered, servo percussive tonal experience unlike any other.

## What We'll Be Using

Electronics:
Arduino
4 RS120 Servos
MIDI Connector
Optoisolator
Resistors: 220, 270, 100 (2), 1000
Diode
Voltage?
12 volt power supply

Base:
4 Glasses
Dremel with flex shaft
10" diameter wooden clock base, 3/4" thick
3/4" thick solid wood (we used a spare stair tread we had laying around, plywood would also work)
  enough for 4 3" squares, and 4 3/4" x 3/4" x 1" blocks
3/16" ply for cams (1/8" would work), a 3" x 10" piece is plenty
Thumb Tacks
Masking Tape
Small wooden bead (1)
Cotton twine
4 3" narrow hinges with screws

## Electronics

Follow the images and wiring diagram.

## Building the Base

We're going to lay out all the cutlines on the clock face first. First, draw two perpendicular diameters. Make a mark at 2" and 2 1/4" in from the circle's edge along each line. The 2" mark is where we're going to drill.
