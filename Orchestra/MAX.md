How MAX works
=============

MAX is a piece of software that lets developers design programs for controlling MIDI
syntheriszers and other advanced audio things such as Samplers and Effects Processors.

MAX is primarily a graphical based languge for building the programs that control MIDI devices
and is used in WebLab to take signals from the network, 'do some magic' send commands to the MIDI
device and then send commands back on the network to syncrhonise all the web clients.

Simple right? Not really. :)

This document describes roughly how the MAX product is configured to let you play music from your
website via MIDI.
